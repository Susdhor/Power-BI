### Visualization Icon 📊
A visualization (or visual) is a type of chart built by Power BI designers. The visuals display the data from reports and semantic models. Because they're highly interactive, you can slice, filter, highlight, change, and even drill into visualizations.

### Semantic Model Icon 🗃️
A semantic model is a container of data. For example, it might be an Excel file from the World Health Organization. It might also be a company-owned database of customers or it might be a Salesforce file. Semantic models are managed by designers.

### Dashboard Icon 📰
A dashboard is a single screen with tiles of interactive visuals, text, and graphics. A dashboard collects your most important metrics, on one screen, to tell a story or answer a question. The dashboard content comes from one or more reports and one or more semantic models.


### Report Icon 📑
A report is one or more pages of interactive visuals, text, and graphics that together make up a single report. Power BI bases a report on a single semantic model. Often, the designer organizes report pages to each address a central area of interest or answer a single question.


### App Icon 📱
An app is a way for designers to bundle and share related dashboards, reports, and semantic models together. Business users receive some apps automatically but can go search for other apps created by colleagues or by the community. For example, out-of-the-box apps are available for external services you may already use, like Google Analytics and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

# Workspaces in Power BI
Workspaces are places to collaborate with colleagues on specific content. Workspaces are created by Power BI designers to hold collections of dashboards and reports. The designer can then share the workspace with colleagues. Designers can also bundle a collection of dashboards and reports into an app and distribute it to the entire community, to their organization, or to specific people or groups. Certain types of apps called template apps, create a workspace when the app is installed.

Everyone using the Power BI service also has a My workspace. My workspace is your personal sandbox where you can create content for yourself.
