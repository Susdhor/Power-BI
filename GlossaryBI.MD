# Power BI Glossary
# A
## Account

Use your work or school account to seamlessly sign in to Power BI. Administrators have the authority to manage work or school accounts through Microsoft Entra ID. The extent of your access is dictated by the Power BI license linked to your account and the capacity type in which content is stored. Refer to the License and Premium section for detailed information.

## Admin Portal

The Admin Portal serves as the centralized hub for Power BI administrators to oversee users, features, and settings within their organization's Power BI environment. It provides a comprehensive interface for efficient management and customization of Power BI functionalities.


## Aggregates

When the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input based on criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning or measurement. Only implicit measures (see definition) can be aggregated.

## Aggregation

The reduction of rows in underlying data sources to fit in a model. The result is an aggregate.

## Alert, Alerts

A feature that notifies users of changes in the data based on limits they set. Alerts can be set on tiles pinned from report visuals. Users receive alerts on the service and on their mobile app.

## Annotate

To write lines, text, or stamps on a snapshot copy of a tile, report, or visual on the Power BI mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

## App, Apps

A bundle of dashboards, reports, and semantic models. It also refers to the mobile apps for consuming content, such as the Power BI app for iOS.

## AppSource

Centralized online repository where you can browse and discover dashboards, reports, semantic models, and apps to download.

## ArcGIS for Power BI

ArcGIS is a mapping and analytics platform created by the company Esri. The name of the visual included in the Power BI visuals library is called ArcGIS for Power BI.

## Auto Insights

Auto Insights are now called Quick Insights.

# B

## BI

Business intelligence.

## Bookmark

A view of data captured in the Bookmarks pane of a report in Power BI Desktop or service. In Desktop, the bookmarks are saved in the pbix report file for sharing on the Power BI service.

## Breadcrumbs

The navigation at the top left to quickly navigate between reports and dashboards.

# C

## Calculation

A mathematical determination of the size or number of something.

## Capacity

[Power BI Premium] Data models running on hardware fully managed by Microsoft in Microsoft cloud data centers to help ensure consistent performance at scale. BI solutions are delivered to the entire organization regardless of Power BI license.

## Card (Visual Type)

A Power BI visualization type.

## Card (Power BI Home)

Power BI Home displays rectangular and square pictures that represent dashboards, reports, apps, and more. These pictures are referred to as cards.

## Certified Custom Visual

A Power BI custom visual that met requirements and passed strict security testing.

## Connect Live

A method of connecting to SQL Server Analysis Services data models. Also called a live connection.

## Connector

Power BI Desktop includes an ever-growing collection of data connectors that are built to connect to a specific data source. Examples include: GitHub, MailChimp, Power BI dataflows, Google Analytics, Python, SQL Server, Zendesk, and more than 100 additional data sources.

## Container

The areas on the navigation pane are containers. In the nav pane, you find containers for: Browse, Data hub, Apps, Metrics, Deployment pipelines, Learn, Workspaces, and Home.

## Content

Content for the Power BI service is generally dashboards, reports, and apps. It can also include workbooks and semantic models.

## Content List

The content index for an app.

## Content View

The view that lists Power BI content you created or content that designers shared with you.

## Continuous Variable

A continuous variable can be any value between its minimum and maximum limits; otherwise, it's a discrete variable. Examples are temperature, weight, age, and time. Continuous variables can include fractions or portions of the value. The total number of blue skateboards sold is a discrete variable since we can't sell half a skateboard.

## Correlation

A correlation tells us how the behavior of things is related. If their patterns of increase and decrease are similar, then they're positively correlated. And if their patterns are opposite, then they're negatively correlated. For example, if sales of our red skateboard increase each time we run a TV marketing campaign, then sales of the red skateboard and the TV campaign are positively correlated.

## Cross-Filter

Applies to visual interactions. Cross-filtering removes data that doesn't apply. For example, selecting Moderation in the doughnut chart cross-filters the line chart. The line chart now displays only data points that apply to the Moderation segment.

## Cross-Highlight

Applies to visual interactions. Cross-highlighting retains all the original data points but dims the portion that doesn't apply to your selection. For example, selecting Moderation in the doughnut chart cross-highlights the column chart. The column chart dims all the data that doesn't apply to the Moderation segment and highlights all the data that does apply to the Moderation segment.

## Custom Visual

Visuals that the community and Microsoft create. They can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store for use in Power BI reports.


## D

## Dashboard

In the Power BI service, a dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story. Dashboards can be created and viewed only in the Power BI service, not in Power BI Desktop. For more information, see Basic concepts for the Power BI service business user.

## Data Connector

See connectors.

## Data Model, Excel Data Model

In Power BI content, a data model refers to a map of data structures in a table format. The data model shows the relationships that are being used to build databases. Report designers, administrators, and developers create and work with data models to create Power BI content.

## Dataflow

Dataflows ingest, transform, integrate, and enrich big data by defining data source connections, Extract Transform Load (ETL) logic, refresh schedules, and more. Formerly called "data pool."

## Dataset

Refer to semantic model.

## Diamond

Power BI Premium. The shape of the icon that signifies a workspace is a Premium capacity workspace.

## Dimension

Dimensions are categorical (text) data. A dimension describes a person, object, item, product, place, and time. In a semantic model, dimensions are a way to group measures into useful categories. For our skateboard company, some dimensions might include looking at sales (a measure) by model, color, country/region, or marketing campaign.

## Drill Up, Drill Down, Drillthrough

In Power BI, "drill down" and "drill up" refer to the ability to explore the next level of detail in a report or visual. "Drill through" refers to the ability to select a part of a visual and be taken to another page in the report, filtered to the data that relates to the part of the visual you selected on the original page. Drill to details commonly means to show the underlying records.


## E

## Editing View

The mode in which report designers can explore, design, build, and share a report.

## Ellipsis

(...) menu. Selecting an ellipsis displays the menu options. Also referred to as the More actions or More options menu, depending on the menu options.

## Embed Code

A common standard across the internet. In Power BI, the customer can generate an embed code and copy it to place content such as a report visual on a website or blog.

## Embedded

See Power BI Embedded.

## Embedding

In the Power BI developer offering, the process of integrating analytics into apps using the Power BI REST APIs and the Power BI SDK.

## Environment

[Power BI Desktop, Power BI Mobile, the Power BI service, and others] Another way to refer to one of the Power BI tools. It's OK to use Power BI environment (tenant) in documentation where it might help business analysts who are familiar with the term tenant to know it's the same thing.

## Explicit Measures

Power BI uses explicit measures and implicit measures (see definition). Explicit measures are created by report designers and saved with the semantic model. They're displayed in Power BI as fields, and can therefore be used over and over. For example, a report designer creates an explicit measure TotalInvoice that sums all invoice amounts. Colleagues who use that semantic model, and who have edit access to the report, can select that field and use it to create a visual. When an explicit measure is added or dragged onto a report canvas, Power BI doesn't apply an aggregation. Creating explicit measures 

## F

## Favorite, Unfavorite

Verb meaning to add to the Favorites list for quick access to frequently visited dashboards and reports in Power BI. When you no longer want them as a favorite, you unfavorite them.

## Filter versus Highlight

A filter removes data that doesn't apply. A highlight grays out the data that doesn't apply.

## Focus Mode

Use focus mode to pop out a visual or tile to see more detail. You can still interact with the visual or tile while in focus mode.

## Free Account

See account.

## Full Screen, Full-Screen Mode

Use full-screen mode to view Power BI content without the distraction of menus and navigation panes. Full screen is sometimes referred to as TV mode.


## G

## Gateways or On-Premises Data Gateways

A bridge to underlying data sources. It provides quick and secure data transfer between the Power BI service and on-premises data sources that support refresh. Usually managed by IT.


## H

## High-Density Visuals

Visuals with more data points than Power BI can render. Power BI samples the data to show the shape and outliers.

## Home

The default landing page for Power BI service users. Doesn't modify anything. Can be called Power BI Home or simply Home.
